A custom made PCB with 4 smd micro sd slots, a usb b micro, and a esp32 with a tracker, so you will never lose it.

At the bottom half is a NFC Key it uses 2 flat 6x6 tactile switches and 2 M24SR64-YDW6T 8KB. Thanks to N-O-D-E for the inspiration. Here is his website. (N-O-D-E.net)

Currently designing the PCB. Any help is welcome and greatly appreciated. Contact me at (therunningcelery@gmail.com)
